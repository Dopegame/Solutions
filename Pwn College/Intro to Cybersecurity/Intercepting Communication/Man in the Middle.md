# Man in the Middle

#### This challenge was pretty ridiculous. I wrote multiple scripts that would almost work but could never get the flag. After a couple days I said f-it and started using AI to help and went through around 20+ iterations of scripts trying to solve it. Nothing worked and so I ended up looking up online a solution just to finally see what I was doing wrong, which oddly enough was nothing. The scripts the AI and I had written were identical to other users solutions. But, and this is the most frustrating part, is even the other users solutions didn't work. I ran 4 different users scripts dozens of times and they never worked. Then after another day or so of crafting scripts and using AI, I went back for fun and ran one of the online scripts I found, and it worked. Immediately ran it again to test, and it didn't work. Ran it another 20 times, didn't work. So, I have no idea how to actually solve this challenge other than blind luck. Also just in case anyone ever finds this, I ran every iterations in a seperate terminal to reset the network and shell.
